# Question: How would you implement a stack that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a stack data structure that supports retrieving the minimum element in constant time. The class `MinStack` contains two private `Stack<int>` objects: `mainStack` and `minStack`. The `mainStack` is used to store all elements, while `minStack` is used to keep track of the minimum element. When a new element is pushed onto the stack using the `Push` method, it is added to `mainStack` and, if it is less than or equal to the current minimum (or if `minStack` is empty), it is also pushed onto `minStack`. When an element is removed from the stack using the `Pop` method, it is removed from `mainStack` and, if it is the current minimum, it is also removed from `minStack`. The `Top` method returns the top element of `mainStack`, and the `GetMin` method returns the top element of `minStack`, which is always the minimum element of the stack. This design allows the minimum element to be retrieved in constant time, regardless of the size of the stack.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows the same logic as the C# version. Both versions use two stacks: a main stack for storing the elements and an auxiliary stack for keeping track of the minimum element. The push, pop, top, and getMin operations are implemented in a similar way in both versions.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of Python and C#:

1. In Python, lists are used to implement the stacks, while in C#, the Stack class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace is used. Python lists have built-in methods for stack operations: append() for push, pop() for pop, and list indexing [-1] for peek/top.

2. In Python, the constructor method is named __init__, while in C#, it's the class name.

3. Python uses the 'self' keyword to refer to the instance of the class, while C# uses 'this'. However, 'this' is often omitted in C# as it's implicit.

4. Python uses 'def' to define a method, while C# uses the access modifier 'public' followed by the return type.

5. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, while C# uses curly braces {}.

6. Python does not have explicit type declarations, while C# requires them.

7. Python uses 'not' for logical negation, while C# uses '!'.

8. Python uses 'or' for logical disjunction, while C# uses '||'.

9. Python uses 'if' for conditional statements without parentheses, while C# uses 'if' with parentheses.

10. Python raises exceptions using the 'raise' keyword, while C# uses the 'throw' keyword. However, in these solutions, the Python version does not explicitly handle the case when the stack is empty, while the C# version throws an InvalidOperationException.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are very similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both versions use two stacks, one for storing all the elements and another for keeping track of the minimum elements. The methods used in both versions are also similar, with `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, and `isEmpty()` or `Count` being used in both versions.

However, there are a few differences between the two versions due to the differences between the Java and C# languages:

1. In the C# version, the `Count` property is used to check if the stack is empty, while in the Java version, the `isEmpty()` method is used.

2. In the C# version, the `Pop()` method is used to remove an element from the stack and return it. In the Java version, the `pop()` method is also used to remove an element, but it does not return the removed element. Instead, the removed element is compared with the top element of the `minStack` using the `equals()` method.

3. Exception Handling: In the C# version, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown when trying to pop or peek an empty stack. In the Java version, the `EmptyStackException` is implicitly thrown when trying to pop or peek an empty stack.

4. Output: In C#, `Console.WriteLine()` is used to print output to the console, while in Java, `System.out.println()` is used.

5. In C#, the `int` type is used for the elements in the stack, while in Java, the `Integer` wrapper class is used. This is because Java's `Stack` class uses generics and requires object types.
